Python People Manager üìù

This is a simple console-based application for managing a list of people. You can add new people, view existing ones, and update or delete their details. All data is stored in a people.json file.
Features ‚ú®

    Add New People: Enter details for a new person (name, age, gender).

    Display People: View a formatted list of all people stored in the application.

    Update Details: Change the name, age, or gender of an existing person.

    Delete a Person: Remove a specific person from the list.

    Clear All Data: Delete all people from the people.json file.

    View Statistics: See the total number of people and their average age.

How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

The application loads all people data from a people.json file when it starts. All changes‚Äîadding, updating, or deleting‚Äîare applied to the in-memory list first and then saved back to the people.json file to ensure the data is always up to date.
